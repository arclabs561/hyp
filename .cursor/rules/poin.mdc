# Poin Rules

## General Principles

- **Mathematical Precision**: Implementations must match mathematical definitions exactly.
- **Numerical Stability**: Handle boundary conditions (near unit ball edge) gracefully.
- **Performance**: Operations are often in inner loops of GNNs.

## Architecture

Poin provides:
- Poincare Ball model
- Lorentz model (future)
- Mobius operations
- Distance functions
- Log/Exp maps

**Rule**: Keep dependencies minimal (`ndarray`, `num-traits`).

## Rust Standards

- All code must compile (`cargo check`).
- All code must be formatted (`cargo fmt`).
- All clippy warnings must be fixed (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`).
- Tests should pass (`cargo test`).
- Use `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations.
- Avoid `unwrap()` in production code.

## Documentation

- Docstrings must include LaTeX math formulas (or clear text approximations) for operations.
- References to papers (e.g., Ganea et al., Nickel & Kiela) are required.

## Integration

Poin is used by:
- `lattix-nn`: Hyperbolic GNN layers
- `lattix-kge`: Hyperbolic KGE models (MuRP, RotH style)

## Anti-Sycophancy

- Challenge assumptions and identify issues.
- Present alternative approaches with trade-offs.
- Use direct technical language.
